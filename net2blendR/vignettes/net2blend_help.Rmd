# Initial set up

### R

We can then load the library. We'll also load igraph to build our networks.

```{r, setup,warning=FALSE,results=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(igraph)
library(net2blendR)
```


# Basic network export

### R

Here we'll walk through the most basic export possible.

For this example, we'll load an artificial network provided with the package.

```{r prepdata}
data(examplenet1)
summary(examplenet1)

```
This is a simple randomly generated graph. Currently the only attribute is a name attribute for each vertex. We can now generate a simple circle layout for this graph.

```{r layout1}

l1=as.data.frame(layout_in_circle(examplenet1))
row.names(l1)=V(examplenet1)$name
head(l1)

```

Note that these coordinates are all between -1 and 1. When imported into Blender these coordinates will be in the scene units, meters by default. We'll multiply by 10 to avoid our network being too squashed.

```{r layout2}
l1=l1*10

```

We can then export this network using the graph, layout and the default settings of net2blend. We set the name of the network to be examplenet. 

```{r net2blend1}

net2blend(examplenet1,l1,netname="examplenet")

```

This will generate two files. One contains vertex data "examplenet_vdata_0_.csv" the other edge data "examplenet_edata_0_.csv".

### Blender

Open Blender and create a new general scene. Delete the default cube. If you have installed the net2blend add-on correctly you should find the "Import network" tab in the side bar (if this is hidden, click the circled arrow). 

`r paste0('<img src="',filepath,'blender1.jpg" title="Empty scene" alt="Empty scene" width="100%" />')`



We'll use the "import single network" tool to import the network. Set the edge and vertex files and click the import network button. The network will be imported.


`r paste0('<img src="',filepath,'blender2.jpg" title="Import network" alt="Import network" width="100%" />')`

You'll see that 2 collections have been added to the scene. "examplenetnodes" (yes I'm sorry, I have been inconsistent in my use of vertices/nodes) and "examplenetedges". The vertices and edges are found within these collections. 

`r paste0('<img src="',filepath,'blender3.jpg" title="Network objects" alt="Network objects" width="100%" />')`

You now have a network as a 3d object in Blender, ready to render!

# Animating networks

We'll now look at how we can animate these networks in Blender. When you import a network a [keyframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame) is automatically added for every vertex and edge. Blender will interpolate between two keyframes, creating a smooth transition. When we imported our network in the previous example, the "Frame" argument was set to 0, meaning keyframes were added at frame 0. If we import another network with the same edges/vertices 

We'll first add simple animation to the existing network and then look at how to set up networks to animate edges/vertices appearing and disappearing.

## Simple example

In this example we'll add some simple changes to the network in our next keyframe. We'll keep the network the same, but change the export settings.

### R

First we'll generate a new layout. Once again we multiply everything by 10 to put it on a better scale in blender. Since we are working in 3d space, lets also move the network up by 10 meters. 

```{r layout3}

l2=as.data.frame(layout_in_circle(examplenet1))
row.names(l2)=V(examplenet1)$name
l2=l2*10
l2$Z = 10 #adding a Z column
```

we'll export the network with the new layout and different colour vertex and edges. Importantly, we keep the same network name "examplenet". This means that when we import these files, they will edit the existing networks, either overwriting existing keyframes (if imported at frame 0) or adding new keyframes (if added at any other frame). We give it a different netname2, meaning the filenames will have a different suffix to distinguish it. The filenames will be "examplenet_vdata_2_.csv" and "examplenet_edata_2_.csv".

```{r net2blend2}

net2blend(examplenet1,l2,netname="examplenet",netname2=2,edge.color = "red",vertex.color = "blue")

```

### Blender

In blender, change the edge and vertex data paths to the new files. Set the frame to 30 and click import.

`r paste0('<img src="',filepath,'blender4.jpg" title="New keyframe" alt="New keyframe" width="100%" />')`

If the network seems to disappear, it is because your current viewpoint isn't pulled back enough to see the network's new Z position. The current frame on the timeline will be set to 30, where a new keyframe has been added for every node and edge. You can slide the timeline back and forth and see the network move and change colour.
